# Unified Server and LLM Manager Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Server Process Management
**Problem**: The `ServerManager` wasn't properly tracking and cleaning up server processes, leading to issues when stopping the server.

**Fixes**:
- Added proper process tracking with PID storage
- Implemented comprehensive process cleanup with `killExistingServerProcesses()`
- Added process termination handlers for graceful shutdown
- Improved error handling and status reporting

### 2. Process Cleanup
**Problem**: Server processes weren't being properly killed when the "Stop Server" button was clicked.

**Fixes**:
- Added multiple cleanup strategies:
  - Direct process termination via `Process.terminate()`
  - Graceful shutdown with timeout
  - Force kill with `Process.interrupt()`
  - System-level process killing with `pkill`
  - PID file cleanup
- Added status checking timer to monitor server health
- Implemented proper deallocation cleanup in `deinit`

### 3. Configuration Management
**Problem**: Configuration changes required manual server restart without clear indication.

**Fixes**:
- Added `needsServerRestart` flag to track configuration changes
- Implemented visual indicators when restart is required:
  - Orange warning triangle on restart button
  - Red background when restart is needed
  - Notification banner with "Restart Now" button
- Added automatic restart functionality in LLM management tab

### 4. Signal Handling
**Problem**: The daemon didn't handle all termination signals properly.

**Fixes**:
- Added SIGTERM signal handling in addition to SIGINT
- Improved graceful shutdown logging
- Enhanced TelnetServer shutdown with proper logging

### 5. Status Monitoring
**Problem**: No continuous monitoring of server status.

**Fixes**:
- Added periodic status checking timer (every 5 seconds)
- Automatic detection of server crashes or unexpected termination
- Proper cleanup of timers when server stops

## New Features Added

### 1. Restart Server Button
- Added to LLM management tab for easy server restart
- Visual indicators when restart is needed
- Automatic restart after configuration changes

### 2. Configuration Change Notifications
- Banner notification when server restart is required
- Clear messaging about what changes were made
- Quick "Restart Now" button for immediate action

### 3. Enhanced Process Management
- Better process lifecycle management
- Improved error reporting
- More robust cleanup procedures

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Memory Management
- Added proper cleanup in `deinit` methods
- Timer invalidation to prevent memory leaks
- Weak references in closures to prevent retain cycles

### 2. Error Handling
- More comprehensive error catching and reporting
- Graceful fallbacks when processes fail to start/stop
- Better status message management

### 3. User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for all server states
- Immediate feedback for configuration changes
- Intuitive restart workflow

## Testing

Both the main app (`PetsponderApp`) and daemon (`PetsponderDaemon`) build successfully without warnings or errors.

## Usage

1. **Starting the Server**: Click "Start Server" in the Server tab
2. **Stopping the Server**: Click "Stop Server" - now properly cleans up all processes
3. **Configuration Changes**: When you change default model or system prompt, a notification will appear
4. **Restarting**: Use the "Restart Server" button in the Models tab or the "Restart Now" button in the notification
5. **Monitoring**: The app now continuously monitors server status and will detect if it crashes

The unified management interface now provides a much more robust and user-friendly experience for managing both the server and LLM models.
